       <p> Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about intro to algorathims</p>
       <p><i> How do i report errors?</i></p>
       <p> First visit the <u> erreta page</u> to verify that the error has not been reported already. Once that you have determined that you've found an unreported error, send email at <u> clrs-bugs@mit.edu.</u></p>
       <p><i> Do you correct errors?</i></p>
       <p> Yes, each time a new printing is produced, it contains corrections to all errors that have been reported by that time.</p>
